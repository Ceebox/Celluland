# Celluland

## About

A small app built with JavaScript and HTML Canvas / WebGL for experimentation with different cellular automata algorithms.

In theory, Celluland has been built in a manner that allows it to be embedded in other sites, however more work is still needed to make it nice. Check out the `/examples` folder to see what I mean.

## Contributing

I'm not really sure if you want to contribute to this. Most of the code for it was written while I was sitting on a beach with a beer, but if you have a problem or want to request a feature, file an issue and I will see what I can do.
